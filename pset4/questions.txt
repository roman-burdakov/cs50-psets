0.  Color support: GIF - 256; BMP - 16.7M (but might vary based on header input); 
    PNG - 256T (281,474,976,710,656); JPEG - 16.7M
1.  GIF supports animation
2.  Lossless compression is used when every single bit of data can be restored.
    Lossy compression permanently reduces information that it treats as 
    redundant as far as compression algorythm is conserned.
3.  Lossy-compressed - JPEG
4.  The first character of the directory entry is changed to 0xE5.
    It is only overwritten if/when a new directory overwrites it.
5.  Do a "secure delete" which overwrites bits with random noise or all "0" 
6.  stdint.h defines number of standard type and typedefs including but not 
    limted by uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t , uint16_t - which are used in bmp.h
7.  stdint.h is used for specific sizes of integer data types. Those types are
    robust and portable to any architecture (i.e. 16/32/64bits) and reserves 
    right amount of memory
8.  1, 4, 4, 2 bytes respectively
9.  first 2 bytes are usef for the header field which identifies the BMP file
10. bfSize used to store full file size while biSize is for 
    the header size (BITMAPCOREHEADER)
11. It means that the image lines are stored top-down, not bottom-up as usual
12. biBitCount specifies color depth in BMP image
13. If we have filed to create a file. Might be if we don't have disk space or 
    more likely permissions to write files in the given directory.
14. Because we always read one byte at the time for each pixel which is 1 byte.
15. biWidth represents width of the bitmap in pixels minus the padding. 
    A scanline number must be a multiple of 4, thus: 3 px * bytes per pixel 
    = 9 bytes + x = 12 to be multiple by 4. Thus the answer is 3 bytes.
16. moves position indicator to a specific location in a stream (like file)
17. SEEK_CUR is a current position of the file pointer
18. Looks like David Malan
